## about me  


I am **Will Thompson**, a PhD student in **Complex Systems and Data Science** at the [Vermont Complex Systems Center](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/). I work in the [Joint Lab](https://joint-lab.github.io/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Jean-Gabriel Young](https://jgyoung.ca/) and [Laurent Hébert-Dufresne](https://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/).

I received a **B.A. in the Liberal Arts** from [St. John’s College](https://www.sjc.edu/) in Santa Fe, NM (May 2020). Afterward, I joined the **Modeling and Analysis Innovation Center** at the [MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org/our-impact/mitre-labs/modeling-and-analysis-innovation-center). I later worked as a **post-bac researcher** at **Los Alamos National Laboratory** on [Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills](https://ccm.mit.edu/), a sub-GeV dark-matter detector.


## research

My research centers on how things spread on networks: biological contagions on contact networks, memes on social media, or activation patterns in neural networks. I build statistical models that bridge theory and data.

I am interested in deep connections among **network dynamics, learning & inference theory, and statistical physics**. By understanding how these fields relate and exploiting connections between them, I hope to develop not only better tools but a better understanding of complex systems in general.
