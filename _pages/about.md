## about me  


I am **Will Thompson**, a PhD student in **Complex Systems and Data Science** at the [Vermont Complex Systems Center](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/). I work in the [Joint Lab](https://joint-lab.github.io/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Jean-Gabriel Young](https://jgyoung.ca/) and [Laurent Hébert-Dufresne](https://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/).

I received a **B.A. in the Liberal Arts** from [St. John’s College](https://www.sjc.edu/) in Santa Fe, NM (May 2020). Afterward, I joined the **Modeling and Analysis Innovation Center** at the [MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org/our-impact/mitre-labs/modeling-and-analysis-innovation-center). I later worked as a **post-bac researcher** at **Los Alamos National Laboratory** on [Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills](https://ccm.mit.edu/), a sub-GeV dark-matter detector.


## research

I study how information and dynamics flow through networks. My research sits at the junction of Network Science, Bayesian Inference, and Machine Learning.

I am primarily interested in inverse problems for network dynamics, reconstructing the underlying rules of a system from dynamics on a network. My current work focuses on three key challenges:

- **Graphical Models**: Understanding why algorithms like Belief Propagation fail on loopy graphs and how to "tune" them on loopy graphs.

- **Sampling-Free Inference**: Developing Fourier-space representations for Bayesian Neural Networks to enable exact learning without expensive sampling.

- **Learning Social Dynamics**: Reverse-engineering the rules of social and biological contagions by observing their spread across complex networks.
