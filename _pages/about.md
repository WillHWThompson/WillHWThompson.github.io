### about
Welcome! I am a PhD student in complex systems and data science at the [**University of Vermont's Complex Systems Center**](https://vermontcomplexsystems.org/) in the [**Computational Story Lab**](https://compstorylab.org/). My interests include computational social science, physics and philosophy.

From 2021 to 2022 I worked as a post-bac researcher at **Los Alamos National Labs** working on the [Coherent Captain  Mills](http://ccm.mit.edu/) searching for sub-GeV dark matter. In 2019 I worked for the **MITRE corporation** applying complex systems science to solve real world problems. In 2020 I graduated from **St. John's College Santa Fe**  where I studied philosophy and the history of math and science. 

### research 
My research involves the computational social sciences. I am fascinated by large scale social phenomena and how we can use tools from complex systems and physics to study social systems.
