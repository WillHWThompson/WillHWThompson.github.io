### About

Welcome! I am a PhD student in complex systems and data science at the *Universty of Vermont's Complex Systems Center*. My interests include computational social science, physics and philosophy.

From 2021 to 2022 I worked as a post-bac reserach at *Los Alamos National Labs* working on the [Coherent Captian Mills](http://ccm.mit.edu/) searching for sub-GeV dark matter. In 2020 I worked for the *MITRE corporation* applying complex systems science to solve real world problems. In 2020 I graduated from *St. John's College Santa Fe*  where I studied philosophy and the history of math and science.
