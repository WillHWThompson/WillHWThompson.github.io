This is a test post to verify that the blog is working properly. I've been working on various aspects of complex systems and network science, including:

## Current Research Areas

- **Network Inference**: Developing methods to reconstruct interaction networks from observed dynamics
- **Higher-Order Networks**: Understanding how group interactions affect collective behavior
- **Opinion Dynamics**: Modeling polarization and consensus formation in social systems

## Recent Work

My recent work focuses on understanding how we can infer the structure of complex networks from observed dynamic processes. This involves developing new mathematical frameworks and computational methods.

### Key Findings

1. Network structure significantly impacts dynamic processes
2. Higher-order interactions can lead to unexpected emergent behaviors
3. Polarization emerges naturally in certain network configurations

This research has applications in social media analysis, epidemic modeling, and understanding collective decision-making processes.
